Q: What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A: - A local repository would be created.
   - In this repository i can store my files.

Q: How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
   What value do you think it offers?   
A: - The stagin area collects all files before I commit them into a repository.
   - I can do some tests with a different version.
   - Maybe I need to work on a feature and in the staging area is a bugfix which is 
     influenced from this feature.
