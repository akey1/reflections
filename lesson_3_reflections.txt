Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A: - If we want to share the files with others.
   - If you want a backup outside of your computer.
   - Perhaps someone see or find a bug in the files.
   
Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A: - I don't want to lose the changes I made.
   - Perhaps I have a better solution to a problem.
